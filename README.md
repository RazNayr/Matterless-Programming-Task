# Matterless-Programming-Task

Matterless programming task for Unity hires

Make a simple app where you can place two labels in AR, each displaying the distance to the camera in real time.

Requirements
* The two labels should be anchored to the real world.
* The distance to each individual label to the camera should be displayed in realtime.
* Only ARFoundation can be used


BONUS POINTS:
* You can only use one monobehaviour.
* This one monobehaviour does no logic, it just delegates tasks to Unity so that Unity could be replaced by another engine easily.
* Render the distance as a line between camera and label, change color based on distance.
* Clean, minimalistic and functional code that's easy to understand for another developer.
